# Cellular Automata Simulator â€“ Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains a Python project that implements **Conway's Game of Life**, a classic cellular automaton, using **PyQt5** for the graphical interface and **Matplotlib** for real-time metric visualization.

## Features

- Interactive 2D grid with click-to-toggle cells
- Start, stop, clear, and randomize the simulation
- Real-time graph showing:
  - ðŸ”µ Live Cells: number of live cells per generation
  - ðŸŸ  Occupancy %: percentage of the grid occupied
  - ðŸŸ¢ Growth Î”: change in the number of live cells from the previous step

## What's included

This repository contains:

- âœ… Python source code for the simulator (`.py`)
- âœ… Graphical user interface built with PyQt5
- âœ… Real-time analysis plot using Matplotlib
- âœ… ðŸ“„ **PDF article** explaining the theory and implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
  - Includes background, rules, example patterns, and discussion
  - Suitable for academic use, learning, or documentation

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 matplotlib numpy
